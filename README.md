# Problem Staement 
In conflict zones, the proliferation of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms exacerbates tensions and fuels animosity between opposing factions. To address this critical issue and promote peacebuilding efforts, there is a pressing need for a robust fake post detection system. The aim of this project is to develop and deploy an advanced algorithmic solution that can accurately identify and mitigate the spread of fake news on the True Social platform in conflict-affected regions. By implementing this system, our goal is to create a safer and more trustworthy online environment, where users can engage in meaningful discourse without being misled by false information. This initiative not only safeguards the integrity of True Social but also contributes to fostering understanding and reconciliation between communities in conflict-ridden areas.

# How to run the project
1. Add your Ngrok authorization token and run the FAKE_NEWS_LSTM.ipyn in google colab copy the link generated in bottom.
1. Else run the google colab add the your_model.h5 and tokenizer.sav file in same directory as of flask_app.py and run the flask_app and copy the link generated.
2.  Add it in client env REACT_APP_PREDICT_URL and fetch in CreatePost component. Add other env information.
3.  In server run nodemon index.js
4.  In client run npm start.



# Key Components:
Comprehensive social media functionalities enabling seamless user interaction, content sharing, and engagement.
Utilization of advanced neural network models to detect and mitigate the spread of fake news and misinformation.
Recognition and support for diverse mental health concerns, leveraging AI algorithms for early detection and tailored interventions.
Implementation of stringent privacy measures, including JWT and double authentication, to ensure user data security and confidentiality.
