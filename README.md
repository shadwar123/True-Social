# Problem Staement 
In conflict zones, the proliferation of fake news and misinformation on social media platforms exacerbates tensions and fuels animosity between opposing factions. To address this critical issue and promote peacebuilding efforts, there is a pressing need for a robust fake post detection system. The aim of this project is to develop and deploy an advanced algorithmic solution that can accurately identify and mitigate the spread of fake news on the True Social platform in conflict-affected regions. By implementing this system, our goal is to create a safer and more trustworthy online environment, where users can engage in meaningful discourse without being misled by false information. This initiative not only safeguards the integrity of True Social but also contributes to fostering understanding and reconciliation between communities in conflict-ridden areas.



# Key Components:
1. NLP Integration: The chatbot utilizes NLP to comprehend and respond effectively to user inputs, ensuring a more natural and meaningful interaction.

2. Sentiment Analysis: Incorporation of sentiment analysis allows the chatbot to gauge the emotional state of users and respond with empathy and understanding.

3. Diverse Mental Health Recognition: The system is designed to identify and address a wide spectrum of mental health issues, acknowledging the complexities and nuances associated with each concern.

4. Privacy and Data Security: Utmost priority is given to ensuring the privacy and security of user data, as sensitive information is shared. Adherence to stringent data protection measures and compliance with healthcare regulations are integral to the design.

5. Escalation to Human Therapists: The chatbot is equipped to recognize situations that require human intervention and can smoothly escalate conversations to professional therapists, ensuring appropriate and timely support.
